Protecting our customers’ information is of utmost importance to us. Our Security Team works with researchers to ensure all vulnerabilities submitted to us are reviewed and actioned.

We appreciate security researchers who help us keep our employees and customers safe by reporting vulnerabilities that may exist on our platform. If you believe you have discovered a possible security vulnerability, please help us to fix it as quickly as possible by submitting your findings in accordance with our disclosure policy below


### Our commitment to you 
 
We will review all submissions and provide timely and clear responses on validation.
  
Please note that this is not a bug bounty program, but we will recognise the efforts of those researchers who help us improve our security controls when we see fit. 

The prioritization and rating of a submission will be based upon a number of factors including, but not limited to, the Bugcrowd Vulnerability Rating Taxonomy and the business impact of the vulnerability reported.  |

We will determine the worst possible credible scenario for the submission and keep you informed.
- Do not modify or attempt to access data that does not belong to you.
